##### Overview

This is the second project that is part of the UTA Software Engineering Bootcamp,

All website code, styles, and images in included in the website folder.

The website is hosted on Github pages [https://silverbelly.github.io/SE-Bootcamp-Project2/website](https://silverbelly.github.io/SE-Bootcamp-Project2/website)

##### Basic functionality

- Users select a type query and provide a keyword
- When the search button is clicked, an API call is constructed based on user input
- Results are displayed in a grid with paging control

##### Technologies Used

- HTML
- Javascript
- Bootstrap is leveraged for creating a consistent look and feel.
- CSS is implemented in an custom style sheet for overriding/extending Bootstrap colors and fonts.
